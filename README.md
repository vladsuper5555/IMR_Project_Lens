#LENS

Created and set up the Hololens project in Unity

Managed to display and manipulate text and make it follow the users head  -> for the subtitles

Managed to interact with the text, when clicked it changes -> for the user menu

Worked on the Hololens emulator for Windows to be able to test the project as we develop

Wrote code for the speech to text feature

Set up translation API for the translation to other language feature
