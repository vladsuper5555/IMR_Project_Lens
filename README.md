# LENS

Created and set up the Hololens project in Unity

Managed to display and manipulate text and make it follow the users head  -> for the subtitles

Managed to interact with the text, when clicked it changes -> for the user menu

Wrote code for the speech to text feature

Week 10 :

-> Worked on the Hololens emulator for Windows to be able to test the project as we develop

-> Set up translation API for the translation to other language feature

Week 11 :

-> Made the Hololens emulator work, we can now test the project without the device

-> Made the connection between devices using web sockets

-> Integrated the Hugging Face API in Unity

Conclusion : We now have a first version of the final project, where a person who wears the Hololens can speak and the other person wearing the Hololens will see the subtitles
